# Research Repository

This repository serves as a collection of resources, code snippets, experiments, and findings related to my ongoing exploration of various programming languages, paradigms, and their practical applications.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this repository is to document and share insights gained from experimenting with different programming languages. This could range from language-specific features to performance analysis, syntax exploration, and building sample projects.
